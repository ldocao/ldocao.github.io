#S2DS, a short summary

##Overview
Science 2 Data Science (S2DS) is a 5-weeks intensive workshop held in London (or should I say Harrow-on-the-hill) during summer, organized by Pivigo. It includes lectures (Hadoop ecosystem, Natural Language Processing, Python, etc.) and a teamwork project based on a real data science problem submitted by a partner company. A very wide variety of subjects (eg: insurance, biology) and techniques (eg: clustering, neural network) are proposed. You will be asked what are your preferences beforehand.

##Schedule
Pivigo provides on-campus accomodation consisting of a single room with bathroom. It's rather small but does perfectly the job. The lectures are given mostly by company employees (engineers, software developers), and some by academics for the first 2 weeks, although the total effective lecture time is more or less 1 week because it happens only in the morning. After that, the full day is dedicated to your project. You will have 1 mentor from Pivigo, and usually 1 mentor from the company which provided the problem to help you out and give you guidance during your project.
